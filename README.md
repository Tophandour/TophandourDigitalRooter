# TophandourDigitalRooter

This project converts letters into numbers (a = 1, b = 2, etc) and gets the digital root. For example: abc = 123 which gives the digital root of 6.

Executable opens a command line (windows 64 bit only right now, let me know if you want it compiled for other systems or install the go compiler and do it yourself). Type in text and press enter to calculate the digital root of the text. A-Z, 0-9 are counted, other characters are just ignored. The program will prompt if you want to quit, type n and press enter to quit, or just press enter to continue. If you continue, you can enter text again.
